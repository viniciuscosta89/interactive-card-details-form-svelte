- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Project IDX](https://idx.dev/) - An experimental, web-based, integrated development environment
- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) - JS library
- [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) - Svelte framework
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS with superpowers
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - TypeScript is JavaScript with syntax for types
- [Felte](https://felte.dev/) - An extensible form library for Svelte, Solid and React
- [Zod](https://zod.dev/) - TypeScript-first schema validation with static type inference

- [validator.js](https://github.com/validatorjs/validator.js) - A library of string validators and sanitizers

### What I learned

Two main points in this project: Project IDX and Svelte.
Since I like new stuff, I'd like to try Project IDX from Google. It's VSCode online basically. You can install extensions on your IDE and install packages on your project.

And Svelte because it's an alternative to React and Vue for me. It has some different ideas but sometimes remembers React and sometimes Vue.
